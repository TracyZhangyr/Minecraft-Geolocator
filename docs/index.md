# Background Story
Steve is visiting Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, as a first-time visitor, he lost his wallet and everything he has except his laptop. This is not even the worst part. The worst part is that Steve is LOST. He doesnâ€™t know which direction he is heading, where he currently is, and how he could get home before nighttime. He tries to ask for help, but it was no use. No one on the streets wanted to help this dude with a cube head. Poor Steve, he just wanted to go home. We, students from the course CS 175 (Project in Artificial Intelligence), decide to help him through our machine learning model: Geolocator. Steve could use his laptop to take a picture, and Geolocator would provide him with his location by utilizing the picture Steve just took.
